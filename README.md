# Awesome Mathematical Notation Design

[![Awesome](https://awesome.re/badge.svg)](https://awesome.re)

While the [history of mathematical notation][history] dates back thousands of years, many of the symbols we are familiar with were introduced in the 16thâ€“17th century. Since then, the number of advanced mathematical symbols has [increased significantly][symbolic-stage].

Today, the majority of mathematical notation is digitally communicated in LaTeX, a popular mathematical typesetting system that produces static output.
But sometimes mathematical notation can be hard to learn, hard to remember, and drag a reader into the details while preventing the communication of some higher-level idea. Can we do better?

Below is list of links of *techniques to help enhance mathematical notation*, for example, leveraging color, layout, annotations, Gestalt principles, or interactivity.
